## Author Name
### Authors Using Initials
Some authors use a space between initials in their name (J. K. Rowling), some do not (J.R.R. Tolkien). 

We should use the spacing of the author's preference. The URL slug should use no dashes between initials. For example, `jk-rowling` or `jrr-tolkein`.

### Authors published primarily in another language
At present, Hardcover's default language is English. Wherever possible, we'd like to rename authors written in other alphabets (Cyrillic, Hebrew, Hanzi, etc.) to be translated to English.

The original name, if verified to be written in the author's native language, can be added to the personal name field or bio.

**Example:** Yevgeni Grishkovetz (Евгений Гришковец)

## Photos and Biography
Author biographical information is very important to Hardcover. We'd like authors to be portrayed accurately, with the most current and verifiable information available. As such, we have strict guidelines around these pages, as well as the sources we leverage to populate them.

### General guidelines

Bios should be written concisely, using a neutral and objective tone. Avoid including any data that has its own dedicated field, demographic or otherwise (self-identified gender, BIPOC, LGBTQ+, location, dates, etc.) Do not editorialize.

Photographs should be of the author, and not of their book covers or other images. They should be high quality and ideally a professional headshot. If the author has a preferred photo, it should be used. If not, use the most recent and high-quality image available.

### Sourcing biographical information

**Acceptable sources for author bios and photos are listed as follows, in order of authority:**

1. An author's official website or book
    - These are the preferred sources for both biography and photo.
2. A Publisher's website
    - This is often a solid fallback for the author's website. It may be out of date. Updates are encouraged.
3. Author's verified social media
    - We prefer about sections, bios, or pinned posts written in the author's voice.
4. Bookseller bios (Amazon, Kobo)
    - Acceptable only when no author or publisher-supplied sources can be found.
    - If used, librarians must write their own summary based on the information found — not copy/paste.
    - When in doubt, err on the side of omission rather than potential infringement.

**Unacceptable sources:**
1. ChatGPT / AI-generated bios
    - The least we can do to support authors is use human-vetted and supplied biographical information.
2. Wikipedia
    - Unless the author is a confirmed contributor (which would go against Wikipedia's standards)
3. Goodreads / The StoryGraph
    - At Hardcover we're looking to build better, not directly copy competitors.

### Citing sources
Until we support a distinct field for bio sources, please include a note at the end of the biography in parentheses. Please avoid using HTML or markdown as this syntax is not supported.

### Preferred file type for author photos
PNG and JPEG work the best. WebP files are not currently supported. The cover shouldn't have any transparency to it. The image is converted to a WebP file before we show it regardless of what you upload.

### Preferred file size
The larger the photo the better! If you want to upload a 15mb file, go for it. We'll resize it for optimal display around the site.

Author photos on Hardcover (as of July 27, 2025) are displayed at a maximum size of 178px by 178px. Uploading images smaller than this may result in blurriness when enlarged. For best results, we recommend uploading photos that are at least 300px wide and 300px high. Images do not need to be square.

### What dimensions qualify for red, yellow and green?
We show three different quality scores for photos today. This is calculated using `height x width`.

0 - 32,999: <Badge text="Bad Quality" variant="danger" /> (ex 133 x 200)

33,000 - 99,999: <Badge text="Ok Quality" variant="caution" /> (ex: 200 x 300)

100,000 +: <Badge text="Good Quality" variant="success" /> (ex: 300 x 450)

## Personal Name
This field is intended only for cases where an author's full name differs from the name they publish under and is publicly known in that context (e.g., in publishing credits or legal attributions).

Do not use this field to list a birth name that an author has changed, such as after a gender transition. Avoid deadnaming, even if the information is publicly available. When in doubt, prioritize the author's privacy and self-identification over completeness.

Do not use this field for pseudonyms, pen names, or stage names. On Hardcover, these are classified as aliases. The exception being if the author has only ever published under a pseudonym, pen name, or stage name. In this case the author's personal name should be used to denote the name they were born with, or the name they are most commonly known by outside of their writing.

Notable Examples:
- Samuel Langhorne Clemens (Mark Twain)
- Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (Lewis Carroll)
- Mary Ann Evans (George Eliot)
- Eric Arthur Blair (George Orwell)

## Aliases
In our current implementation, we allow for a single alias per author. For authors that exist as a pseudonym, pen name, or stage name, this is the field to use to denote the primary author on Hardcover.

Examples: 
- Stephen King is the primary author, but he has written under the alias Richard Bachman.
- Isaac Asimov is the primary author, but he has written under the alias Paul French.
- Nora Roberts is the primary author, but she has written under the alias J.D. Robb.

In any of these cases, add the primary author under the "Alias of" field on the alias page.

## Demographic information
For authors, we collect the following demographic information:
- Self-identified gender
- BIPOC status
- LGBTQ+ status

These fields are optional, and we encourage librarians to only fill them out if the author has self-identified in their bio or on their website. If the author has not provided this information, please leave these fields blank.

## Location
Location information for author is not always readily available. If the author has a location listed on their website, or in their bio, please use that information. If not, you can leave the location field blank.

For deceased authors, we recommend using the location of their birth or where they spent most of their life. If this information is not available, you can leave the location field blank.

## Dates of birth and death
If exact dates are not publicly and readily available, please use the year only in the appropriate field.

## Reaching out to Authors

We want authors to feel welcomed to the platform, and some of the best ambassadors for that are Librarians! It shows them that we care about how they're represented on the platform and want their page to be the best it can be.

We welcome librarians to contact authors on their own behalf, with the support of Hardcover. But for this to work, we require all outreach to be added to the [contacted authors list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MlaWgpBYdaLxxTwmYZxhQ0xPNqi4kZQ4J4CVPXa6Vxg/edit?gid=308756447#gid=308756447).

We don't want to overwhelm authors with repeated contact. To prevent portraying Hardcover as a spammy platform, we ask that Librarians refer to the list and add the author they'd like to contact before doing so. You can do this using the Hardcover [Author Outreach Form](https://forms.gle/ewUDjfe7SV8RdaWd6).

Only after verifying that they have not yet been contacted and adding them to to the list via the form, you can use the Hardcover [Author Outreach Email Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fUmholoNHE9dR45LEREXeRUk-iwrKhlYtbzjLz9sGS8/edit?usp=sharing). This can be sent from your email, or through a contact form on the author's website.
