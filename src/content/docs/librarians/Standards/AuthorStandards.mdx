## Author Name
### Authors Using Initials
Some authors use a space between initials in their name (J. K. Rowling), some do not (J.R.R. Tolkien). 

We should use the spacing of the author's preference. The URL slug should use no dashes between initials. For example, `jk-rowling` or `jrr-tolkein`.

### Authors published primarily in another language
At present, Hardcover’s default language is English. Wherever possible, we’d like to rename authors written in other alphabets (Cyrillic, Hebrew, Hanzi, etc.) to be translated to English.

The original name, if verified to be written in the author’s native language, can be added to the personal name field or bio.

**Example:** Yevgeni Grishkovetz (Евгений Гришковец)

## Photos and Biography
Author biographical information is very important to Hardcover. We'd like authors to be portrayed accurately, with the most current and verifiable information available. As such, we have strict guidelines around these pages, as well as the sources we leverage to populate them.

### General guidelines

Bios should be written concisely, using a neutral and objective tone. Avoid including any data that has its own dedicated field, demographic or otherwise (self-identified gender, BIPOC, LGBTQ+, location, dates, etc.) Do not editorialize.

### Sourcing biographical information

**Acceptable sources for author bios are listed as follows, in order of authority:**

1. An author's official website or book
    - These are the preferred sources for both biography and photo.
2. A Publisher's website
    - This is often a solid fallback for the author's website. It may be out of date. Updates are encouraged.
3. Author's verified social media
    - We prefer about sections, bios, or pinned posts written in the author's voice.
4. Bookseller bios (Amazon, Kobo)
    - Acceptable only when no author or publisher-supplied sources can be found.
    - Librarians are strongly encouraged to rewrite these to avoid outright plagiarism.

**Unacceptable sources:**
1. ChatGPT / AI-generated bios
    - The least we can do to support authors is use human-vetted and supplied biographical information.
2. Wikipedia
    - Unless the author is a confirmed contributor (which would go against Wikipedia's standards)
3. Goodreads / The StoryGraph
    - At Hardcover we're looking to build better, not directly copy competitors.

### Citing sources
Until we support a distinct field for bio sources, please include a note at the end of the biography in parentheses. Please avoid using HTML or markdown as this syntax is not supported.

## Reaching out to Authors

We want authors to feel welcomed to the platform, and some of the best ambassadors for that are Librarians! It shows them that we care about how they’re represented on the platform and want their page to be the best it can be.

We welcome librarians to contact authors on their own behalf, with the support of Hardcover. But for this to work, we require all outreach to be added to the [contacted authors list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MlaWgpBYdaLxxTwmYZxhQ0xPNqi4kZQ4J4CVPXa6Vxg/edit?gid=308756447#gid=308756447).

We don't want to overwhelm authors with repeated contact. To prevent portraying Hardcover as a spammy platform, we ask that Librarians refer to the list and add the author they'd like to contact before doing so. You can do this using the Hardcover [Author Outreach Form](https://forms.gle/ewUDjfe7SV8RdaWd6).

Only after verifying that they have not yet been contacted and adding them to to the list via the form, you can use the Hardcover [Author Outreach Email Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fUmholoNHE9dR45LEREXeRUk-iwrKhlYtbzjLz9sGS8/edit?usp=sharing). This can be sent from your email, or through a contact form on the author's website.
