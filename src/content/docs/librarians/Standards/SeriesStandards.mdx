## Duplicate Series Names
For multiple series with the same name, adjust the additional series as follows:
  - Append `(Author Name)` to the series name 
  - Append `-AuthorName` to the slug

## Publisher Collections (E.g., Penguin Little Black Classics)
For publisher or other collections where only a specific edition of a book is part of the series, a Hardcover series should not be created. The book may be instead added to a list.
