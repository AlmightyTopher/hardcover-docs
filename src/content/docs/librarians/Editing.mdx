## General
### When combining duplicate books/series/authors, which version should you keep?
In the case of Authors, series and characters, keep the one with the canonical English name.

For books, choose the one with the most readers using it. When another reader selects that book to read, we’ll default the “edition” that reader read to be the primary edition for this book. By selecting the book with the most readers, that means the next people who read it will also be assigned the same popular edition.

###The book cover is blurry even though the cover edition has a high resolution image
Check if the file is a webp - these are able to be uploaded (even as .jpgs) but are not processed correctly. If you're uploading and the best available filetype is webp, you can save as another type such as PNG in any image editor before uploading to hardcover.

## Editions
###An ISBN is already in use incorrectly on another edition
Remove the ISBN from the wrong book using the "Hard Reset" button, then add it to the correct edition.

## Series
### Series book count numbers low or thumbnails missing from series on author/book pages
The series book count and series previews only consider books with a published date. Check to make sure that at least one edition for all books in the series has a valid published date.
