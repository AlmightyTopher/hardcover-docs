## General
### What is the authoratative source for book descriptions / other information?
In order of preference:
1. Publisher
2. Author Official Website
3. BookBub / WorldCat
4. Bookstore (Barnes & Noble, Amazon, etc)
5. Other Book Site (Open Library, Google Books, etc)

### My update didn’t work? What’s going on?
This is a bug Adam’s currently working on getting to the bottom of. If you run into this, you can either skip that book for now, or start a thread in the librarian channel with as much information as possible to help reproduce the error (link to the page you were editing, what fields you changed).

### When combining duplicate books/series/authors, which version should you keep?
In the case of Authors, series and characters, keep the one with the canonical English name.

For books, choose the one with the most readers using it. When another reader selects that book to read, we’ll default the “edition” that reader read to be the primary edition for this book. By selecting the book with the most readers, that means the next people who read it will also be assigned the same popular edition.

### The book cover is blurry even though the cover edition has a high resolution image
Check to make sure the file is not a webp (sometimes webp files from publishers or authors are even incorrectly marked with a .jpg extension). If this is the case you can save as in any image editor to convert to a true jpg or png before uploading to hardcover.

## Editions
### An ISBN is already in use incorrectly on another edition
Remove the ISBN from the wrong book using the "Hard Reset" button, then add it to the correct edition.

## Series
### Series book count numbers low or thumbnails missing from series on author/book pages
The series book count and series previews only consider books with a published date. Check to make sure that at least one edition for all books in the series has a valid published date.
