# What is a Contribution?

A Contribution in Hardcover represents the relationship between an author and a book or edition, along with the specific role the author played. This flexible system allows for various types of contributions including writing, illustration, translation, editing, and more, providing detailed credit information for all contributors to a work.

## Get Book Contributors

Retrieve all contributors for a specific book with their roles:

<GraphQLExplorer query={`
query GetBookContributors {
    books(where: {id: {_eq: 328491}}) {
        id
        title
        contributions {
            id
            contribution
            author {
                id
                name
                bio
            }
        }
    }
}
`} title="Book Contributors Query"/>

## Get Author's Contributions

Find all works an author has contributed to with their roles:

<GraphQLExplorer query={`
query GetAuthorContributions {
    contributions(
        where: {author_id: {_eq: 80626}}
        order_by: {created_at: desc}
    ) {
        id
        contribution
        contributable_type
        book {
            id
            title
            release_year
            rating
        }
        created_at
    }
}
`} title="Author Contributions Query"/>

## Find Books by Illustrator

Search for books that have illustrators and display their names:

<GraphQLExplorer query={`
query FindBooksByContributor {
    contributions(
        where: {contribution: {_eq: "Illustrator"}}
        order_by: {book: {rating: desc}}
        limit: 20
    ) {
        id
        author {
            name
        }
        book {
            id
            title
            rating
            release_year
        }
    }
}
`} title="Books by Contributor Type"/>

## Find Authors with Multiple Roles

Discover authors who have contributed to books in different roles (e.g., as both author and illustrator):

<Aside type="note">
    This query finds authors who have contributions with roles other than "Author", helping identify versatile creators who write, illustrate, translate, or contribute in multiple ways.
</Aside>

<GraphQLExplorer query={`
query AuthorMultipleRoles {
    authors(
        where: {
            contributions_aggregate: {
                count: {
                    predicate: {_gt: 0},
                    filter: {contribution: {_neq: "Author"}}
                }
            }
        }
    ) {
        id
        name
        contributions_aggregate(
            distinct_on: contribution
        ) {
            nodes {
                contribution
            }
        }
        contributions(
            distinct_on: contribution
            limit: 5
        ) {
            contribution
        }
    }
}
`} title="Authors with Multiple Roles"/>

## Edition-Specific Contributors

Find contributors specific to particular editions:

<GraphQLExplorer query={`
query EditionContributors {
    contributions(
        where: {contributable_type: {_eq: "Edition"}}
        order_by: {created_at: desc}
        limit: 20
    ) {
        id
        contribution
        author {
            name
        }
        # The contributable_id field references the edition ID
        # You can join this with editions table to get edition details
        contributable_id
        created_at
    }
}
`} title="Edition-Specific Contributors"/>

<Aside type="note">
    Edition-specific contributions are used when a contribution applies only to a particular edition, not the work as a whole. Common examples include:
    - Translators for translated editions
    - Narrators for audiobook editions
    - Cover artists for specific print runs
    - Editors for revised editions
    
    The original author is typically credited at the book level, while edition-specific contributors are linked to individual editions.
