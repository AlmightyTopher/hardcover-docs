### Get a List of Books With a Status

To see a selection of the books in your library, replace `##USER_ID##` with your account id, which can be found by completing the "Example Request" section of the [Getting Started](../../api/getting-started) guide. To change the [book status](/api/graphql/schemas/books#user-book-statuses) being queried for, replace the `2` (which represents the "Currently Reading" status) with your desired status.

<GraphQLExplorer query={`
{
    user_books(
        where: {user_id: {_eq: ##USER_ID##}, status_id: {_eq: 2}}
    ) {
        book {
            title
            image {
                url
            }
            contributions {
                author {
                    name
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

    This query will return a list of books that the user has in the "Currently Reading" status.
