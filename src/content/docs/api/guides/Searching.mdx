## What can I search for?

Currently, you can search for authors, books, characters, lists, prompts, publishers, series, and users.
Additional search options will be added in the future.

Behind the scenes, Hardcover uses [Typesense](https://typesense.org/) for search. This same Typesense
index used on the website is used for this endpoint.

The search API does not currently support filtering by parameters besides `query`, however you can
change which attributes (columns) are searched as well as changing sorting.

## Search options

Only `query` is required. If all other fields are blank, this will default to the same search as the Hardcover website when searching for a book.

- `query`* - The search term
- `query_type` - The type of content to search for one of (case-insensitive; default `book`)
                    - `author`
                    - `book`
                    - `character`
                    - `list`
                    - `prompt`
                    - `publisher`
                    - `series`
                    - `user`
- `per_page` - The number of results to return per page (default 25)
- `page` - The page number to return (default 1)
- `sort` - What attributes should the result be sorted by
- `fields` - Which attributes within the given `query_type` to include in the search
- `weights` - A comma separated list of numbers indicating weights to give each of the `fields` when calculating match

<Aside type="note">
    `fields` and `weights` are used togther. If you pass in 2 fields to
    search (ex: `name,name_personal`), you'll also need to pass in 2 weights (`5,1`).
    Weights are relative to each other.
</Aside>

<Aside type="note" title="Note #2">
    Some fields for an object contain other objects or numerical data
    isn't useful for filtering, but could come in handy for sorting or to show
    more information about an entity.
</Aside>
