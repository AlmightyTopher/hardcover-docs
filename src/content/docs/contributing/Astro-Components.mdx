import GraphQLExplorer from '@/components/GraphQLExplorer/GraphQLExplorer.astro';
import SocialIcons from '@/components/SocialIcons.astro';

## Different Types of Components
Currently, there are two types of components available in the documentation site:
- [**Astro Components**](./astro-components): These are components written in Astro and are used to create static HTML pages. Use these components when you don't need any client-side interactivity. Astro components can be used from other Astro components but can not be used from React components.
- [**React Components**](./react-components): These are components written in React and are used to create dynamic, interactive pages. Use these components when you need client-side interactivity or state management. React components can be used from other React components and from Astro components.

## Writing Astro Components
Astro components are written in `.astro` files in the `/src/components` directory.

## Available Astro Components
In addition to the standard [Starlight - Components](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/components/), the Hardcover
documentation site includes the following custom components:

### GraphQL Explorer

This component allows a user to view GraphQL queries and experiment by running them against the API.

**Import Path:**

```js
import GraphQLExplorer from '@/components/GraphQLExplorer/GraphQLExplorer.astro';
```

**Parameters:**

- `canTry` - A boolean value determining whether the user can run the query in the explorer. The default is `true`.
- `description` - A string describing the query.
- `forcePresentation` - A boolean value determining whether the presentation options should be hidden. The default is `false`.
- `presentation` - The default presentation of the response, either `json` or `table`. The default is `json`.
- `query` - A string containing the GraphQL query to be displayed in the explorer.
- `title` - A string for the title of the query shown in the explorer. The default is `Example Query`. Change this when translating the page to another language.

**Usage:**

```mdx
<GraphQLExplorer
    query={query}
    description="An example query"
    presentation='table'
    title="Example"
/>
```

<GraphQLExplorer query={`
query {
    me {
        id,
        username
    }
}
`}/>

### Social Icons

This component is mostly meant for internal use, but it can be used to display the hardcover social media icons.

**Import Path:**

```js

import SocialIcons from '@/components/SocialIcons.astro';

```

**Parameters:**

- `iconSize` - A string for the size of the icons. The default is `16px`.

**Usage:**

```mdx
<div class="flex justify-around h-6 w-80">
    <SocialIcons iconSize="24px" />
</div>
```

<div class="flex justify-around h-6 w-80">
    <SocialIcons iconSize="24px" />
</div>

## Limitations
- Astro components are rendered on the server and do not have access to the browser's `window` or `document` objects.
- Astro components do not support client-side state management or interactivity.
- Astro components cannot be used inside React components.
