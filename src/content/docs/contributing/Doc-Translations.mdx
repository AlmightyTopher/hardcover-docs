# Adding new languages to the language dropdown

The root language should **not** be changed from English.
To add a new language, see [Starlight - Configure i18n](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/i18n/#configure-i18n).

When adding a new language,
you should also update the existing translations in the astro config file to include the new language.
