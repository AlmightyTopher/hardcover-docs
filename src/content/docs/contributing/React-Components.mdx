## Different Types of Components
Currently, there are two types of components available in the documentation site:
- [**Astro Components**](./astro-components): These are components written in Astro and are used to create static HTML pages. Use these components when you don't need any client-side interactivity. Astro components can be used from other Astro components but can not be used from React components.
- [**React Components**](./react-components): These are components written in React and are used to create dynamic, interactive pages. Use these components when you need client-side interactivity or state management. React components can be used from other React components and from Astro components.

## Writing React Components
- React components are written in `.tsx` files in the `/src/components` directory.
- You can use the `useTranslation` and `useTokenTranslation` utility functions from `@/lib/utils` to translate strings in React components.
See [Using Translations in Doc Pages](./using-translations) for more information on how to use translations in React components.
